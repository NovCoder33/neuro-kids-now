          At Neuro Kids Now, we created these programs to support kids with
          neurological conditions who often face long hospital stays, isolation,
          and overwhelming symptoms. Many of these children are neurodivergent
          and experience challenges like anxiety, sensory sensitivity, and
          communication barriers. Through care packages, letters, crafts, and
          community support, our programs are designed to bring comfort,
          connection, and joy to kids who may feel forgotten in the hospital
          system. We believe every child deserves to feel seen, supported, and
          celebratedâ€”especially during tough times!
